       <h3>Why does morning sunlight improve sleep?</h3>
       <p>Morning sunlight is crucial for improving sleep due to its role in regulating our circadian rhythms and hormonal cycles.<br/>
       Exposure to bright light in the morning, especially sunlight, increases the amplitude of the morning cortisol spike by up to 50%, which is beneficial. Elevated cortisol levels in the morning promote wakefulness, focus, and mood throughout the day, which subsequently aids in better sleep at night. This morning light exposure also suppresses melatonin, the hormone responsible for sleep, helping to reset the sleep cycle effectively.
       <br/>Additionally, the bright light signals to the brain to shift from a sleepy state to an alert state. This mechanism helps set a timer for about 16 hours later, facilitating the natural onset of sleep. Morning light exposure also interacts with the adenosine system, washing out residual sleep pressure from insufficient sleep the previous night</p>
