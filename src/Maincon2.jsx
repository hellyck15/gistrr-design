       <h3>How do circadian rhythms affect health?</h3>
       <p><b>1.</b> Circadian rhythms significantly impact health through their regulation of various physiological processes. Here's how:<br/>
       General Health: Aligning with circadian rhythms reduces risks of neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's), psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder), metabolic issues (e.g., obesity, diabetes), cardiovascular diseases, and immune dysfunction. Consistency in routines like sleep and diet helps optimize these rhythms
       <br/><b>2.</b> Sleep and Mood: Circadian rhythms influence neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and GABA, affecting mood and sleep-wake cycles. They also regulate hormones like cortisol, melatonin, and growth hormone, impacting mood, energy levels, and overall well-being</p>
